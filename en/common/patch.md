```
#### Apply a patch to a specific file:
```shell
patch {{path/to/file}} < {{patch.diff}}
```
#### Patch a file writing the result to a different file:
```shell
patch {{path/to/input_file}} -o {{path/to/output_file}} < {{patch.diff}}
```
#### Apply a patch to the current directory:
```shell
patch -p1 < {{patch.diff}}
